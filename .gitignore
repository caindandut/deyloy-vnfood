# Models (Too large for git, usually handled via LFS or download script, but user has them locally)
# If user wants to push models to git, they need Git LFS. 
# For Render Free Tier, pushing 100MB+ models might be slow or hit limits, but let's assume they want to push them for now.
# If they are too big, we might need to ignore them and download them during build.
